## Work Experience


### Teaching - helping people understand

#### Business English Teaching and CV writing, self-employed (2015 - present)			                   
I create and teach bespoke English courses to help non-native business people perform better at work in English. Companies include: BBC, EY, KPMG, Goldman Sachs, Amazon and Banco Sabadell. Placed a client as senior marketing manager at Amazon through CV writing and interview practice services. I run an English teaching Twitter account, @EnglishUpskill (posting since August 2021). TESOL certified.

#### Proofreader, PhDs and Masters dissertations, self-employed, (2016 - 2019)		           		           
I proofread advanced research on a very wide range of topics. This took a lot of research due to both the range of topics and that the client’s English was usually non-native. The result was always a clear thesis.


### Research and writing - communicating facts
#### Freelance Journalism (2013 - 2021) 								                        
I wrote about tech, small businesses, the environment and levelling up. Publications included: the Financial Times, Jewellery Focus, Retail Jeweller, Green Futures, Hackney Citizen, Placemaking Resource Magazine.

#### Summary writer for select committees, Dods Parliamentary Communications Ltd (2016)		         
Dods has been covering parliament since 1832. I summarised select committee discussions and evidence from guests for the weekly publication for an audience of MPs, policy makers and journalists.

#### Content writing, UBN (2010 - 2013)						                	                        
I researched industries, organisations and people to write written features and produce video interviews and events for UBN, a UK-Japanese low-carbon economy professional network. Developed content interviewing UN, heads of state, CEOs and researchers.


### Digital marketing - persuading people

#### Branding and content writing (2014 - 2021)   							      
I deliver branding and marketing strategies. Clients include UK and Japanese small and medium-sized companies but also the Japanese Government (Innovation for Cool Earth Forum).

#### Marketing volunteer, Lead International (LI) (2013 - 2015) 		                		                        
I created a digital marketing strategy to engage LI’s global network on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. LI was an environmental professional network started by the Rockefeller Foundation.

### Social causes

#### Founder, Tech Grads (2015 - 2017)
I partnered with ASOS to offer a free career fair to help young people start digital careers and to get one-to-one career advice. Employers included Tesco, EY, Treatwell and Monzo.

#### Free Legal Advice Centre (FLAC), Toynbee Hall (residential volunteer) (2009 - 2010)
I served members of the public in desperate need of help with debt. I would make them tea, listen carefully to their stories, then create a budget for them and negotiate a payment plan and waivers with their creditors.


## Skills


#### Fact-finding, fact-checking
I frequently wrote for an expert audience while I was brand new to the topic. The foundation was always curiosity and research: reading what was already published, summarising the current problem area, modelling the choices, trade-offs and stakes, then interviewing people who were in a position to know or give informed opinions and communicating what I found in a clear way. I've written for the Financial Times, Green Futures, Hackney Citizen, Retail Jeweller and more.

#### Being a team player, empathy
During our final project, communication broke down numerous times. I helped make different team members feel heard by voicing what I felt was their point of view openly in the group. This allowed us to discuss and overcome the issues as I felt the antagonism was built on misunderstanding. I continued to check in with people throughout the project.

#### Understanding others
My first task as a business English teacher is to make my student feel comfortable. They often take classes because they feel inadequate and stupid at work (having been very competent at work in their own languages). Making them feel understood and safe is the basis for helping them progress, thus building their confidence. I've helped all my students overcome hurdles they couldn't on their own (eliminate written mistakes in email correspondence, interview successfully, present in meetings confidently, understand spoken English, etc). I've had students from the BBC, Goldman Sachs, EY, KPMG, Amazon, Banco Sabadell, Fitch and many more.

In journalism, your readers are your users. Journalism is ultimately about relevance to others. What is important to them, what they know and what they want/need is the starting point for what stories you can tell. 

#### Analysis
Branding and marketing is analytical before it is creative. Its foundation is who the customer is, what pain they have and what your solution is. Many clients struggle to articulate this, so I love the joy they feel when I express their vision in words more clearly than they can. I then develop messaging which is credible, distinctive and persuasive. The best messaging is so clear different stakeholders can ‘think with it’ and it helps them coordinate the work between teams. I've done branding and marketing for diverse clients from small London-based luxury fashion start-ups through to the Government of Japan.
